videoSchema.plugin(mongooseAggregatePaginate)
// A plugin in Mongoose is like an extension or add-on that adds extra features to your schemas or models.
// Think of it like adding new capabilities (e.g., pagination, timestamps, soft delete) to your schema without writing all the logic yourself.


// .aggregate() is used when you want to do more complex stuff.
// Example:
// "Get only travel videos, sort them by views, then group them by year."
// You can't do such things with just .find(). For that, you use .aggregate().
